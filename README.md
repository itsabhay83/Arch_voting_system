# üó≥Ô∏è BlockBallot: A Trustworthy Decentralized Voting System

BlockBallot is a secure, transparent, and verifiable decentralized voting platform built on the Solana blockchain. Designed to reinforce trust in digital interactions, it ensures one-vote-per-wallet integrity, real-time results, and automatic closure of polls ‚Äî all optimized for minimal gas usage.

## Features

- **Customizable Poll Creation**: Users can launch polls with configurable options, duration, and access control.
- **One-Vote-Per-Wallet Security**: On-chain enforcement of single vote per wallet prevents manipulation and fraud.
- **Real-Time Tallying**: See live voting results as votes are cast.
- **Time-Bound Polling**: Automatic poll closure based on duration set at creation.
